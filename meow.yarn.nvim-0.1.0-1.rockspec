      meow.yarn.nvim provides a simple, beautiful, and interactive way to explore LSP hierarchies
      without the usual clutter. It visualizes type and call hierarchies in a clean, intuitive tree view.

      Features:
      - Interactive Tree View: Displays hierarchies in a clear, expandable tree
      - Type Hierarchy: Explore supertypes and subtypes of a class or type
      - Call Hierarchy: Navigate callers (incoming calls) and callees (outgoing calls) of a function
      - Live Preview: See the source code of the selected item in a live preview window
      - Built on Solid Foundations: Powered by Neovim's native LSP and nui.nvim
      - Configurable: Customize keymaps, window appearance, and more
      - Fast & Asynchronous: All LSP requests are handled asynchronously without blocking the UI
